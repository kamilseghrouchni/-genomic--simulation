# Note: lines starting with '#' are comments


# GENERAL PARAMETERS:

# Number of generations _ corresponds to the number of steps in each simulation
GEN = 3000

# Number of replicas _ corresponds to the number of executed simulations
REP = 500

# Marker Sites _ zero-based loci corresponding to the alleles (sequence of nucleotides)
SITES = 0|6

# Population size _ this value is only used if no fasta file is specified
POPSIZE = 5000

# Initial frequencies _ this value is only used if no fasta file is specified
FREQ = 0.8|0.2


# Execution mode: vars are
# 0 - none
# 1 - mutation
# 2 - migration
# 3 - selection
# 4 - variable population size
MODE = 0


# MUTATION PARAMETERS

# Mutation probabilities for each of the marker sites
MUT = 1E-7|1E-7|1E-7

# Mutation model (Cantor model is chosen by default if no other model is picked)

# Uncomment the following line to use the Kimura mutation model
# MUT_KIMURA = 0.5

# Uncomment the following line to use the Felsenstein mutation model
# The rates are in the order 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'
# MUT_FELSENSTEIN = 0.3|0.2|0.2|0.3



# MIGRATION PARAMETERS
# Note: the subpopulations are created such that there are exactly as many subpopulations as there are alleles,
# with each subpopulation containing only one allele at the beginning of the simulation

# If detailed output is activated (= 1), the each subpopulations' allele frequencies are printed to the result file,
# otherwise (= 0) only the global (seen from the total population) frequencies are printed 
MIG_DETAILED_OUTPUT = 0

# Migration patterns: Exchange of individuals amongst sub population
# 1 - completeGraph _ every sub population exchanges with one another
# 2 - star _ every sub population exchanges with the central population, which is chosen randomly
# 3 - ring _ every sub population exchanges with their neighbours
MIG_MODEL = 1

# Migration rates for each subpopulation:
# One value applies for every migration from and to a subpopulation
# Example: 3|5|4
# -> the subpopulation 1 will exchange 3 individuals with subpopulation 2, 3 individuals with subpopulation 3, 3 individuals with subpopulation 4
# -> the subpopulation 2 will exchange 5 individuals with subpopulation 3, 5 individuals with subpopulation 4
# -> the subpopulation 3 will exchange 4 individuals with subpopulation 4

# Note
# - If there are less rates than subpopulations, a migration rate of 0 is automatically chosen for the exchange between those additional subpopulations
# - If the rates are too high (e.g. an exchange of 10 individuals each with 2 other subpops when there are only 15 individuals in a given subpop), they will automatically be adjusted downwards
# - If no values are specified, random rates will be determined for every subpopulation
# MIG_RATES = 3|5



# SELECTION PARAMETERS

# Selection rates for each allele
# Note: values are to be in the range [-1, infinity[, with -1 representing a lethal allele
# Note: if there are more alleles than given values, those additional alleles will have a neutral selection factor of 0
SEL = -0.1|0.1



# VARIABLE POPULATION SIZE PARAMETERS
# The effect takes place between two time points
# The user can specify a factor by which the population is reduced during this interval

# Bottleneck execution mode:
# Reduction _ reduction factor
# Start _ start time of the effect
# End _ end time of the effect
